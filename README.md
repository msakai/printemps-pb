# PRINTEMPS-pb

## Suggested command line

```
python3 DIR/bin/main.py --time-limit TIMELIMIT --tmpdir TMPDIR --seed RANDOMSEED BENCHNAME
```

## Complete or not?

* ☐ Complete (your solver can answer UNSATISFIABLE)
* ☑ Incomplete (your solver can find solutions but cannot prove that there is no solution)

## Categories of benchmarks

* ☑ DEC-LIN (decision problem, linear constraints, no UNSAT certificate)
* ☐ DEC-LIN-CERT (decision problem, linear constraints, UNSAT certificate required)
* ☑ DEC-NLC (decision problem, non-linear constraints, no UNSAT certificate)
* ☑ OPT-LIN (optimization problem, linear constraints, no OPT/UNSAT certificate)
* ☐ OPT-LIN-CERT (optimization problem, linear constraints, OPT/UNSAT certificate required)
* ☑ OPT-NLC (optimization problem, non-linear constraints, no OPT/UNSAT certificate)
* ☑ PARTIAL-LIN (WBO, both soft and hard constraints, linear constraints)
* ☑ SOFT-LIN (WBO, only soft constraints, linear constraints)
